# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-18

### Tier-2, Tier-3 & Tier-4 features (local-first, no backend)

#### Tier-2 — Management
- **Today view** includes overdue open tasks.
- **Bulk operations** — selection mode + batch complete/reopen/star/project/priority/delete.
- **Project labels** — sidebar grouping by optional label.
- **Custom views** — save/apply/delete filter+sort+search presets (persisted).
- **Project templates** — gallery (Umzug, Produkt-Launch, Wochenplanung, Event) → project + tasks.

#### Tier-3 — Collaboration (local)
- **Task comments** with author + timestamp.
- **Activity log** — tracks created/completed/reopened/deleted/project-created (last 200, persisted).
- **Reports** — totals, completion rate, overdue, done-this-week, per-project & per-priority charts.
- **Team & permissions** — local members with roles (admin/editor/viewer) + task assignee.
- **User settings** — persisted profile name + theme.

#### Tier-4 — Advanced
- **Dark mode** — persisted theme applied via `data-theme`.
- **Hashtag quick-add** — `#Projekt` / `@Kategorie` tokens auto-resolve or create.
- **Print/PDF export** — print stylesheet hides chrome; browser "Save as PDF".
- **Email-to-task** — paste email → Inbox task (Subject line → title).
- **Attachments** — files as localStorage data-URLs (≤ 400 KB).

#### Notes
- Deferred: native Mobile App (separate build target) and touch Mobile Gestures (needs hardware).
- `npm run build` + `npm run lint` green at every feature commit; dev server transforms cleanly.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-18

### Tier-1 Core Features Complete (14/14) — full pipeline build

#### Foundation
- Reworked Zustand store: `persist` middleware with a Date reviver (robust localStorage,
  no double-load under StrictMode), `selectedTaskId` instead of a stale `selectedTask`
  object (fixes the stale-edit bug and the circular store type).
- New `Project` and `Category` entities with full CRUD.
- New `src/selectors.ts`: filter / sort / search / priority / calendar scoping.

#### Features
- **Inbox** — default collection of project-less tasks + quick-add.
- **CRUD** — create / edit (all fields, live) / delete tasks.
- **Projects** — create (sidebar), assign (panel), rename + delete (orphans → inbox), open counts.
- **Priority List** — top 5 open tasks (starred → high → due).
- **Task Fields** — title, description, due date, priority, project, categories, recurrence.
- **Completed** — checkbox + strikethrough, click-isolated.
- **Star/Favorite** — toggle in list and panel; feeds the priority list.
- **Categories/Contexts** — create/delete, multi-assign chips, filter pills with colors.
- **Calendar View** — interactive month grid, nav, today, task-count dots, click-to-date, dated quick-add.
- **Recurring Tasks** — daily/weekly/monthly auto-spawn on completion, optional end date.
- **Filter & Sort** — by project/category/priority/status; sort by priority/due/title/created ±dir.
- **Full-Text Search** — title + description, real-time, scoped to the search view.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — `n` new, `/` search, `Esc` close, `Del` delete.
- **UI Polish** — cohesive tokens, typography, hover/active states, responsive breakpoints.

#### Verification
- `npm run build` (tsc + vite) and `npm run lint` green at every feature commit.
- Dev server renders (HTTP 200, modules transform without error).
- Per-feature pipeline artifacts under `docs/pipeline/`.
